     <pre>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
     Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
     While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
     As of some one gently rapping—rapping at my chamber door.
     "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door—
                                       Only this and nothing more."
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Une fois, par un minuit lugubre, tandis que je m'appesantissais,
               faible et fatigué, sur maint curieux et bizarre volume de savoir
               oublié—tandis que je dodelinais la tête, somnolant presque: soudain
               se fit un heurt, comme de quelqu'un frappant doucement, frappant à
               la porte de ma chambre—cela seul et rien de plus.</i>
     </p>
     <pre>Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
     And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
     Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
     From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
     For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
                                       Nameless here for evermore.
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Ah! distinctement je me souviens que c'était en le glacial
               Décembre: et chaque tison, mourant isolé, ouvrageait son spectre
               sur le sol. Ardemment je souhaitais le jour—vainement j'avais
               cherché d'emprunter à mes livres un sursis au chagrin—au chagrin
               de la Lénore perdue—de la rare et rayonnante jeune fille que les
               anges nomment Lénore:—de nom pour elle ici, non, jamais plus!</i>
     </p>
     <pre>And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
     Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
     So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
     "'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
     Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
                                       This it is and nothing more."
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Et de la soie l'incertain et triste bruissement en chaque rideau
               purpural me traversait—m'emplissait de fantastiques terreurs pas
               senties encore: si bien que, pour calmer le battement de mon cœur,
               je demeurais maintenant à répéter « C'est quelque visiteur qui sollicite
               l'entrée, à la porte de ma chambre—quelque visiteur qui sollicite
               l'entrée, à la porte de ma chambre; c'est cela et rien de plus. »</i>
     </p>
     <pre>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
     "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
     But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
     And so faintly you came tapping—tapping at my chamber door,
     That I scarce was sure I heard you"—here I opened wide the door:—
                                      Darkness there and nothing more.
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Mon âme devint subitement plus forte et, n'hésitant davantage
               « Monsieur, dis-je, ou Madame, j'implore véritablement votre pardon;
               mais le fait est que je somnolais et vous vîntes si doucement frapper,
               et si faiblement vous vîntes heurter, heurter à la porte de ma chambre,
               que j'étais à peine sûr de vous avoir entendu. »—Ici j'ouvris, grande,
               la porte: les ténèbres et rien de plus. »</i>
     </p>
     <div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">
     </div>
     <pre>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
     Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
     But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
     And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
     This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"—
                                       Merely this and nothing more.
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Loin dans l'ombre regardant, je me tins longtemps à douter,
               m'étonner et craindre, à rêver des rêves qu'aucun mortel n'avait osé
               rêver encore; mais le silence ne se rompit point et la quiétude ne
               donna de signe: et le seul mot qui se dit, fut le mot chuchoté
               « Lénore! » Je le chuchotai—et un écho murmura de retour le mot
               « Lénore! »—purement cela et rien de plus.</i>
     </p>
     <pre>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
     Soon again I heard a tapping, somewhat louder than before,
     "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
     Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
     Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;—
                                       'Tis the wind and nothing more."
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Rentrant dans la chambre, toute mon âme en feu, j'entendis bientôt
               un heurt en quelque sorte plus fort qu'auparavant. « Sûrement, dis-je,
               sûrement c'est quelque chose à la persienne de ma fenêtre. Voyons
               donc ce qu'il y a et explorons ce mystère—que mon cœur se calme
               un moment et explore ce mystère; c'est le vent et rien de plus. »</i>
     </p>
     <pre>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
     In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
     Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;
     But, with mien of lord and lady, perched above my chamber door—
     Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
                                       Perched and sat and nothing more.
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Au large je poussai le volet; quand, avec maints enjouement et
               agitation d'ailes, entra un majestueux Corbeau des saints jours de
               jadis. Il ne fit pas la moindre révérence, il ne s'arrêta ni n'hésita
               un instant: mais, avec une mine de lord ou de lady, se percha au-dessus
               de la porte de ma chambre—se percha sur un buste de Pallas juste
               au-dessus de la porte de ma chambre—se percha, siégea et rien de plus.</i>
     </p>
     <pre>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
     By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
     "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
     Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
     Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
                                       Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Alors cet oiseau d'ébène induisant ma triste imagination au sourire,
               par le grave et sévère décorum de la contenance qu'il eut: « Quoique
               ta crête soit chue et rase, non! dis-je, tu n'es pas pour sûr un
               poltron, spectral, lugubre et ancien Corbeau, errant loin du rivage
               de Nuit—dis-moi quel est ton nom seigneurial au rivage plutonien de
               Nuit. » Le Corbeau dit: « Jamais plus. »</i>
     </p>
     <pre>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
     Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
     For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
     Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
     Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
                                       With such a name as "Nevermore."
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Je m'émerveillai fort d'entendre ce disgracieux volatile s'énoncer
               aussi clairement, quoique sa réponse n'eût que peu de sens et peu
               d'à-propos; car on ne peut s'empêcher de convenir que nul homme vivant
               n'eût encore l'heur de voir un oiseau au-dessus de la porte de sa
               chambre—un oiseau ou toute autre bête sur le buste sculpté, au-dessus
               de la porte de sa chambre, avec un nom tel que: « Jamais plus. »</i>
     </p>
     <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">
     </div>
     <pre>But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
     That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
     Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered—
     Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before—
     On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."
                                       Then the bird said, "Nevermore."
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Mais le Corbeau, perché solitairement sur ce buste placide, parla
               ce seul mot comme si, son âme, en ce seul mot, il la répandait. Je ne
               proférai donc rien de plus: il n'agita donc pas de plume—jusqu'à ce
               que je fis à peine davantage que marmotter « D'autres amis déjà ont
               pris leur vol—demain il me laissera comme mes Espérances déjà ont
               pris leur vol. » Alors l'oiseau dit: « Jamais plus. »</i>
     </p>
     <pre>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
     "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
     Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful Disaster
     Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
     Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore
                                       Of 'Never—nevermore.'"
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Tressaillant au calme rompu par une réplique si bien parlée: « Sans
               doute dis-je, ce qu'il profère est tout son fonds et son bagage, pris
               à quelque malheureux maître que l'impitoyable Désastre suivit de près
               et de très-près suivit jusqu'à ce que ses chansons comportassent un
               unique refrain; jusqu'à ce que les chants funèbres de son Espérance
               comportassent le mélancolique refrain de « Jamais—jamais plus. »</i>
     </p>
     <pre>But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
     Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
     Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
     Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
     What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
                                       Meant in croaking "Nevermore."
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Le Corbeau induisant toute ma triste âme encore au sourire, je
               roulai soudain un siége à coussins en face de l'oiseau et du buste et
               de la porte; et m'enfonçant dans le velours, je me pris à enchaîner
               songerie à songerie, pensant à ce que cet augural oiseau de jadis—à
               ce que ce sombre, disgracieux, sinistre, maigre et augural oiseau de
               jadis signifiait en croassant: « Jamais plus. »</i>
     </p>
     <pre>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
     To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
     This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
     On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
     But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
                                       <i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>Cela, je m'assis occupé à le conjecturer, mais n'adressant pas une
               syllabe à l'oiseau dont les yeux de feu brûlaient, maintenant, au fond
               de mon sein; cela et plus encore, je m'assis pour le deviner, ma tête
               reposant à l'aise sur la housse de velours des coussins que dévorait
               la lumière de la lampe, housse violette de velours dévoré par la
               lumière de la lampe qu'</i>Elle<i> ne pressera plus, ah! jamais plus.</i>
     </p>
     <pre>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer,
     Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
     "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
     Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
     Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"
                                       Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>L'air, me sembla-t-il, devint alors plus dense, parfumé selon un
               encensoir invisible balancé par les Séraphins dont le pied, dans sa
               chute, tintait sur l'étoffe du parquet. « Misérable, m'écriai-je, ton
               Dieu t'a prêté—il t'a envoyé, par ces anges, le répit—le répit et
               le népenthès dans ta mémoire de Lénore! Bois! oh! bois ce bon népenthès
               et oublie cette Lénore perdue! » Le Corbeau dit: « Jamais plus! »</i>
     </p>
     <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
     </div>
     <pre>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
     Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
     Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
     On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
     Is there—<i>is</i> there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!"
                                       Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
     
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>« Prophète, dis-je, être de malheur! prophète, oui, oiseau ou
               démon! Que si le Tentateur t'envoya ou la tempête t'échoua vers ces
               bords, désolé et encore tout indompté, vers cette déserte terre
               enchantée—vers ce logis par l'horreur hanté: dis-moi véritablement,
               je t'implore! y a-t-il du baume en Judée?—dis-moi, je t'implore. »
               Le Corbeau dit: « Jamais plus! »</i>
     </p>
     <pre>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
     By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
     Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
     It shall clasp a saintly maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
     Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."
                                       Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>« Prophète, dis-je, être de malheur! prophète, oui, oiseau ou
               démon! Par les Cieux sur nous épars—et le Dieu que nous adorons tous
               deux—dis à cette âme de chagrin chargée si, dans le distant Eden,
               elle doit embrasser une jeune fille sanctifiée que les anges nomment
               Lénore—embrasser une rare et rayonnante jeune fille que les anges
               nomment Lénore. » Le Corbeau dit: « Jamais plus! »</i>
     </p>
     <pre>"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting—
     "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
     Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
     Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
     Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
                                       Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
     </pre>
     <p class="french">
          <i>« Que ce mot soit le signal de notre séparation, oiseau ou malin
               esprit, » hurlai-je, en me dressant. « Recule en la tempête et le rivage
               plutonien de Nuit! Ne laisse pas une plume noire ici comme un gage du
               mensonge qu'a proféré ton âme. Laisse inviolé mon abandon! quitte le
               buste au-dessus de ma porte! ôte ton bec de mon cœur et jette ta
               forme loin de ma porte! » Le Corbeau dit: « Jamais plus! »</i>
     </p>
     <pre>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting—still is sitting
     On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
     And his eyes have all the seeming of a Demon's that is dreaming,
     And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
     And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
                                       Shall be lifted—nevermore!

               yeux ont toute la semblance des yeux d'un démon qui rêve, et la
               lumière de la lampe, ruisselant sur lui, projette son ombre à terre: et

     even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
     paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
     Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
     and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
     works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
     
     1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
     or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
     Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
     collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
     individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
     located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
     copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
     works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
     are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
     Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
     freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
     this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
     the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
     keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
     Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
     
     1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
     what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
     a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
     the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
     before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
     creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
     Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
     the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
     States.
     
     1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
     
     1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
     access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
     whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
     phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
     Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
     copied or distributed:
     
     This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
     almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
     re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
     with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net
     
     1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
     from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
     posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
     and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
     or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
     with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
     work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
     through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
     Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
     1.E.9.
     
     1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
     with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
     must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
     terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
     to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
     permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
     
     1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
     work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
     
     1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
     electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
     prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
     active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
     Gutenberg-tm License.
     
     1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
     compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
     word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
     distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
     "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
     posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
     you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
     copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
     request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
     form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
     
     1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
     performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
     unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
     
     1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
     access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
     that
     
     - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
          the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
          you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
          owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
          has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
          Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
          must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
          prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
          returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
          sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
          address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
          the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
     
     - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
          you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
          does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
          License.  You must require such a user to return or
          destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
          and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
          Project Gutenberg-tm works.
     
     - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
          money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
          electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
          of receipt of the work.
     
     - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
          distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
     
     1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
     electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
     forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
     both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
     Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
     Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
     
     1.F.
     
     1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
     effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
     public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
     collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
     works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
     "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
     corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
     property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
     computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
     your equipment.
     
     1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
     of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
     Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
     Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
     Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
     liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
     fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
     LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
     PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
     TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
     INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
     DAMAGE.
     
     1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
     defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
     receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
     written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
     received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
     your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
     the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
     refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
     providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
     receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
     is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
     opportunities to fix the problem.
     
     1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
     in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
     WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
     WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
     
     1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
     warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
     If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
     law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
     interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
     the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
     provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
     
     1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
     trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
     providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
     with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
     promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
     harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
     that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
     or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
     work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
     Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
     
     
     Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
     
     Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
     electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
     including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
     because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
     people in all walks of life.
     
     Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
     assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
     goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
     remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
     Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
     and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
     To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
     and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
     and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

     Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
     Literary Archive Foundation
     
     Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
     spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
     increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
     freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
     array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
     ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
     status with the IRS.
     
     The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
     charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
     States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
     considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
     with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
     where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
     SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
     particular state visit http://pglaf.org
     
     While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
     have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
     against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
     approach us with offers to donate.
     
     International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
     any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
     outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
     
     Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
     methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
     ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
     donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate
     
     
     Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
     works.
     
     Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
     concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
     with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
     Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
     
     
     Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
     editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
     unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
     keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
     
     
     Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
     
          http://www.gutenberg.net
     
     This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
     including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
     Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
     subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
